# Lip-Reading
Deep Learning Model that can LIP READ using Python and Tensorflow

In light of the existing landscape, this project advocates for the adoption of LipNetâ€”a groundbreaking end-to-end model that pioneers sentence-level sequence prediction for visual speech recognition. Unlike prior methodologies, LipNet efficiently processes sequences of images and yields output distributions over sequences of tokens. This project proposes an advanced lip reading model that combines 3D Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs) to improve the accuracy and robustness of lip reading The project's approach involves leveraging the spatio-temporal characteristics of lip motion using 3D CNNs. This allows the model to analyze sequential frames of lip movements and capture both spatial and temporal features simultaneously. The GRU component is employed to learn long-term dependencies and capture temporal dynamics in the lip movement sequences.
